# 8WeeksChallenge-SQL

These questions and challenges are fictional, but give analysts a sense or a feel of what the real world demands and how to answer business-related questions.

Although fun and insightful, the creator of these datasets and questions (Danny Ma) didn't take time to properly review what was released and ask reasonable questions, 
a lot of questions were good, but some didn't make sense and some were unnecessary, but nonetheless, i enjoyed it.

You can get a hold of these challenges and test your abilities as well using: [8WeeksChallenge] (https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)
